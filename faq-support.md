## What is new/different in ClassicPress v1?

Details of the changes in ClassicPress v1 are available in on our [forums](https://forums.classicpress.net/t/classicpress-1-0-0-aurora-release-notes/910).

## Will my current plugins and themes work in ClassicPress?

All current plugins and themes which work in WordPress 4.9.x, will work in ClassicPress v1. If you're experiencing something different, that's probably a bug with ClassicPress, and we'd appreciate you reporting it in the [support forums](https://forums.classicpress.net/c/support), [Slack](https://www.classicpress.net/join-slack/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/issues).

## I’m a developer, will I need to learn any new language or framework to develop in ClassicPress?

Not unless you want to! We have some exciting features planned for version 2 and beyond, but they will all be optional and fully backwards-compatible.

## How can I indicate my plugin/theme is compatible with CP?

Plugins and themes should be tagged <em>ClassicPress</em> to allow users to easily find them when searching on the Wordpress.org site or repositories via the ClassicPress admin panel.

A number of plugins have already been tagged as compatible with ClassicPress and can [easily be found](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/classicpress/) in the WordPress Plugin Repository.

## I think I found a bug – what do I do?
